## Task 1:

Dating nowadays is difficult. There are many people with many different characteristics and interests. This makes making choice with the right partner confusing and tricky. 

Let us use Machine Learning algorithm to study a dataset so that we can get better understanding and insight of interests for future reference *hopefully*. We will be using the **Support Vector Machine a.k.a. (SVM)** Algorithm in order to analyse the dataset. 

**Dataset link has been updated please refer the latest.**

- For the given dataset split the data into **train** (80% of data) and **test** (20% of data) . Find the **accuracy score** by testing the SVM trained on **train spit** using **test split**. Further try to tune the parameters to **maximize** the accuracy score.

- Give output of a **graph plot** which will plot **attractiveness** and **fun**, with a **decision boundary** , a boundary which will separate matched with unmatched, based on our trained SVM.
