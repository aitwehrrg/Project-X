<h1>where my diamonds at ?</h1>

**Task Description:**

You are playing a game of cards with your friends (Each image in a test case is your each friend's draw). Here's the twist. It's your deck of cards and you know how to win everytime!
The back of these cards has this design. But you know the trick to identify which card it is. Two of the design blocks are bigger than the others as shown in the sample image. One represents the number and the other the group i.e Diamond, Clubs, Spade, Heart
Knowing their cards just from the backside, makes you the winner everytime! 

You are provided a set of two test cases consisting of 3 cards each. 
Write a Python/ C++ code which returns a string of the card names. (one string per card) 
Your algorithm output should match the given output for each card.

Example output: ```3 of Spades```, ```Ace of Hearts```, ```5 of Spades```.

**Observe:**

- The numbers range only from Ace, 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6.

- In an upright card only the top row and the left row contain these bigger blocks, hence make sure the card is upright (the algorithm should do this) before finding out the value of the card using your algorithm.

Note:
Add ```@lbhnsh``` and ```@extint``` ,apart from the project mentors, as collaborators to the private repository for the task submission and inform them on whatsapp.
You can use OpenCV functions only to read and transform the images. Hence to solve you, must design your own brute force algorithm.
